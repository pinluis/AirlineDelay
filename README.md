# Airline Delay Prediction

## Introduction

This is a project from [Sven Chen](https://github.com/Slyfter), [Petar Mladenov](https://github.com/petarzhaw) and [Luis Pinheiro](https://github.com/pinluis) for the course `Python-Grundlagen & Anwendung in Data Science (2023-FS)` at [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/) to predict flight delays. The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/airlines-delay).

## Data

The data comes in a .csv file and is also stored in the data folder.

## How to run

The repository is setup to run in a devcontainer. To use the devcontainer, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the `VSCode` extension [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed. Open the repository in VSCode and a pop up window will appear on the bottom right. Select "Reopen in Container" and wait for the container to build. If you don't see a pop up window, you can also use `CTRL + Shift + P` and search for "Reopen in Container". Once the container is built, you can open a terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Correct flow of the project

Our `Jupyter Notebooks` are numbered. By following the numbers, you will see the correct flow of the project. The `Jupyter Notebooks` are also commented, so you can follow the code and see what we are doing and why we are doing it.

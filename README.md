# Airline Delay Prediction

## Introduction

This is a project from [Sven Chen](https://github.com/Slyfter), [Petar Mladenov](https://github.com/petarzhaw) and [Luis Pinheiro](https://github.com/pinluis) for the course `Python-Grundlagen & Anwendung in Data Science (2023-FS)` at [ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/en/university/) to predict flight delays. The data is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/airlines-delay).

## Data

The data comes in a .csv file and is also stored in the data folder.

## How to run

The repository is setup to run in a devcontainer. To use the devcontainer, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and the `VSCode` extension [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed. Open the repository in VSCode and a pop up window will appear on the bottom right. Select "Reopen in Container" and wait for the container to build. If you don't see a pop up window, you can also use `CTRL + Shift + P` and search for "Reopen in Container". Once the container is built, you can open a terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Correct flow of the project

Our `Jupyter Notebooks` are numbered. By following the numbers, you will see the correct flow of the project. The `Jupyter Notebooks` are also commented, so you can follow the code and see what we are doing and why we are doing it.

## Run app locally

To run the app locally, change the directory of your CLI to the app.py and run the flask application using the 'flask run' command. The app is going to run on the port 5000 and can be closed with `CTRL + C`.

```bash
cd app
```

```bash
flask run
```
